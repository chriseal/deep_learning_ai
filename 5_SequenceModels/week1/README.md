# Sequence Models - Week 1

## Why sequence models?

- from sequence to sequence
  - speech recognition - input: audio, output: text
  - music generation - input: null, output: music
  - DNA sequence, machine translation, named entity recognition, video 
  - x and y can have different lengths; only input or only output can be a sequence
