# Convolutional Neural Networks - Week 4

## What is face recognition?

- face verification
  - 1 to 1 problem
  - given image and name/ID output whether or not that image is that person
- face recognition
  - much harder
  - have to compare to entire database --> much more likely to have errors
live face detection (is a picture or a live human)

## One Shot Learning

- only have one image in your training set
- learn a similarity function
  - degree of difference bw two images
  - small number if same person, large number if not
