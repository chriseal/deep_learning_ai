## Orthogonalization

- best ML engineers do one thing at a time
- tv's designed so each knob only does one thing at a time, cars too (not changing direction and speed of car at same time)
- orthogonal controls make machines easier to operate
- Chain of assumptions in ML
  - fit training set well -> fit dev set well -> fit test set well -> perform well in real world
